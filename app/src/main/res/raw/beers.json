Inversion I.P.A. is a phenomenal NW-style I.P.A., beckoning all beer drinkers and enticing I.P.A. lovers to invert their world and find clarity above the routine of the everyday.","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":424,"brewery_id":844,"name":"India Pale Ale","cat_id":3,"style_id":26,"abv":7.5,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":425,"brewery_id":844,"name":"London Porter","cat_id":2,"style_id":25,"abv":6.5,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":426,"brewery_id":742,"name":"Hitachino Nest Celebration Ale 2006","cat_id":-1,"style_id":-1,"abv":9.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":427,"brewery_id":363,"name":"Rubia","cat_id":8,"style_id":95,"abv":6.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":428,"brewery_id":562,"name":"Session Premium Lager","cat_id":8,"style_id":95,"abv":5.1,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":429,"brewery_id":156,"name":"Mocny BOSS / BOSS Beer","cat_id":8,"style_id":95,"abv":8.1,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":430,"brewery_id":127,"name":"La Rossa","cat_id":7,"style_id":90,"abv":7.2,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":431,"brewery_id":905,"name":"Blue Paddle Pilsener","cat_id":7,"style_id":77,"abv":4.8,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"Climb on in and grab a paddle.

In spite of its dark color, it comes across as a soft and elegant brew that is rich, mild, and surprisingly balanced. It never tastes harsh, toasty or acrid. The beer is often referred to as a Schwarzpils, a \"black Pils,\" but, unlike a blond Pils, which can be assertively bitter, the hop bitterness in Schwarzbier is always gentle and subdued.\r\n\r\nIn a glass, Schwarzbier looks much like a British dark ale, but looks can be deceiving. Schwarzbier, unlike a British ale, has a clean lager taste that leaves next to no perception of fruitiness on the palate. Instead, Schwarzbier produces very mild, almost bittersweet, notes of chocolate, coffee, and vanilla. Like most traditional German lagers, Schwarzbier has a malty middle, but the sweetness is never cloying or overpowering. The beer is moderately to well attenuated and the finish tends to be dry. Its alcohol level by volume is in the range of 4.5 to 5%, rarely higher. To accentuate the Schwarzbier's dark elegance and appealing head, always serve it in a tall, fluted or tulip-shaped glass.","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":481,"brewery_id":296,"name":"St. Bernardus Tripel","cat_id":5,"style_id":61,"abv":8.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"This beer, with high fermentation, has a pale amber colour and a flowery, fruity taste with a harmonious balance between sweet and sour (8% alcohol content). \r\nThis beer has a thick and vivid froth and strikes by its balanced taste with a delicate bitterness.","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":482,"brewery_id":296,"name":"Bire Blanche","cat_id":-1,"style_id":-1,"abv":0.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":483,"brewery_id":1375,"name":"Wychcraft","cat_id":-1,"style_id":-1,"abv":0.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":484,"brewery_id":1204,"name":"Double Bastard Ale","cat_id":3,"style_id":26,"abv":10.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":485,"brewery_id":7,"name":"Rochefort 6","cat_id":3,"style_id":29,"abv":7.5,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"eddish colour, almost like autumn leaves, very consistent texture with a slightly spicy aroma and an intense taste of caramel, fruit, and hints of raisins.

This style was traditionally the session beer consumed by the porters in London.","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":1433,"brewery_id":619,"name":"Dort","cat_id":7,"style_id":90,"abv":6.5,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":1434,"brewery_id":803,"name":"8-Ball Stout","cat_id":3,"style_id":42,"abv":0.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":1435,"brewery_id":1153,"name":"Milkhouse Stout","cat_id":3,"style_id":42,"abv":0.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":1436,"brewery_id":1153,"name":"Old 47 Ale","cat_id":3,"style_id":26,"abv":0.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":1437,"brewery_id":1153,"name":"Shawano Gold","cat_id":-1,"style_id":-1,"abv":0.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":1438,"brewery_id":23,"name":"Speciale Reserve Ale","cat_id":3,"style_id":26,"abv":0.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":1439,"brewery_id":875,"name":"Scorpion Pale Ale","cat_id":3,"style_id":26,"abv":0.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":1440,"brewery_id":18,"name":"Export","cat_id":-1,"style_id":-1,"abv":5.4,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":1441,"brewery_id":1263,"name":"Dry Stout","cat_id":3,"style_id":42,"abv":0.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":1442,"brewery_id":1263,"name":"Dark Wheat","cat_id":-1,"style_id":-1,"abv":0.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":1443,"brewery_id":1263,"name":"Cream Ale","cat_id":8,"style_id":95,"abv":0.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":1444,"brewery_id":1263,"name":"Porter","cat_id":2,"style_id":25,"abv":0.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":1445,"brewery_id":1263,"name":"Amber Ale","cat_id":3,"style_id":33,"abv":0.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":1446,"brewery_id":1263,"name":"Summer Gueuze","cat_id":5,"style_id":70,"abv":0.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":1447,"brewery_id":590,"name":"Double Gueuze (discontinued)","cat_id":5,"style_id":70,"abv":0.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":1448,"brewery_id":590,"name":"Pioneer Pale Ale (discontinued)","cat_id":3,"style_id":26,"abv":0.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":1449,"brewery_id":590,"name":"English Brown Ale (discontinued)","cat_id":3,"style_id":38,"abv":0.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":1450,"brewery_id":590,"name":"Octoberfest (discontinued)","cat_id":7,"style_id":84,"abv":0.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":1451,"brewery_id":258,"name":"Porter","cat_id":2,"style_id":25,"abv":0.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":1452,"brewery_id":1065,"name":"Pilsner","cat_id":-1,"style_id":-1,"abv":0.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":1453,"brewery_id":1065,"name":"Hefeweizen","cat_id":4,"style_id":50,"abv":0.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":1454,"brewery_id":1219,"name":"Sherwood Forest IPA","cat_id":3,"style_id":31,"abv":6.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":1455,"brewery_id":65,"name":"Cat Tail Pale Ale","cat_id":3,"style_id":26,"abv":0.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":1456,"brewery_id":549,"name":"Centennial IPA","cat_id":3,"style_id":31,"abv":7.2,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"Selected as a benchmark for the Beer Judge Certification Program used in all American based beer judgings.

lager yeast strain and dark chocolaty malts to redefine what dark beer can be. In 1997, a Fort Collins flood destroyed the original recipe our researcher, Phil Benstein, found in the library. So Phil and brewmaster, Peter Bouckaert, traveled to Belgium to retrieve this unique style lost to the ages. Their first challenge was deciphering antiquated script and outdated units of measurement, but trial and error (and many months of in-house sampling) culminated in 1554, a highly quaffable dark beer with a moderate body and mouthfeel.","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":1806,"brewery_id":135,"name":"Dark

So lift up a pint of Bitter Woman IPA and toast Aunt Cal and the bitter woman you know.  Cheers!\r\n\r\nBitter Woman IPA is our Wisconsin variation of an India Pale Ale.

It is derived from bitter ales but contains even more alcohol and hops. This helped preserve the beer on its long sea journey around Cape Hope to India.\r\n\r\nBritish troops returning from India brought their love of this beer back with them so breweries began brewing it for the home market as well. Sadly, the style had mostly died out in England by the late twentieth century.\r\n\r\nAmerican home brewers began to brew I.P.A. because of their love for the intense hoppiness of the style. In time American I.P.A.s became much more aggressively bitter and hoppy than their historical predecessors.\r\n\r\nBig Eye I.P.A. is our version of this wonderful style.  American Centennial hops are  used exclusively to bitter, flavor, finish, and dry hop the Big Eye. Its full hop flavor is guaranteed to please the palate of the true hop

three malts and one hop. Its light amber color and slightly spicy malt character are derived from the use of German Dark Munich Malt and Rye Malt respectively. North American 2-row barley combines with the other grains to lay the foundation for the hop onslaught to come. Summit hops are used exclusively in the boil for bitterness, flavor and aroma but it doesnt end there. Post-fermentation dry hopping allows the 9.5% ABV monstrosity to gently coax the citrus rind and grapefruit aroma to join the 100 IBUs already present. This beer should greet you with a pungent citrus blast, provide a spicy yet round middle and finish with a brisk, clean bitterness.","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":2531,"brewery_id":155,"name":"Dunkel","cat_id":-1,"style_id":-1,"abv":0.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":2532,"brewery_id":146,"name":"Altbier","cat_id":3,"style_id":38,"abv":0.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":2533,"brewery_id":1204,"name":"4th

bitterness.","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":2562,"brewery_id":1006,"name":"Premium","cat_id":-1,"style_id":-1,"abv":5.1,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":2563,"brewery_id":303,"name":"Brigand","cat_id":-1,"style_id":-1,"abv":9.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":2564,"brewery_id":309,"name":"Krakus","cat_id":-1,"style_id":-1,"abv":0.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":2565,"brewery_id":268,"name":"Kriek","cat_id":5,"style_id":70,"abv":0.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":2566,"brewery_id":39,"name":"Small

The on-going fermentation inside the bottle will change the character of the beer as it ages, and you'll find it becomes dryer with age. You may want to lay down a few bottles for future evaluation.

Staying true to the experimental nature of the series and the never settle philosophy of Deschutes, our brewers went back to the drawing board to create an amplified version of last years monument to hops.\r\n\r\nHead Brewer Brett Porter says, This is a truly exciting and groundbreaking beer. We reformulated everything about the hop recipe to give Hop Henge an extraordinary aroma and flavor similar to a fresh hop beer. In addition to the Cascade and Centennial hops, Deschutes Brewery is experimenting with a hop variety so new that it has yet to be named.\r\n\r\nThe team here at Bend Public House recommends Hop Henge as the perfect accompaniment for a variety of spicy foods, so be sure to have a bottle handy next time you make a batch of hot wings and go for the five alarm award. The high-octane hoppiness is a wildly refreshing antidote to a wide array of hot foods.\r\n\r\nLimited Availability April through June.\r\n\r\nDont miss this amazing hop experiment that is sure to leave your taste buds begging for more.\r\n\r\n-http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/Brews/Bond+Street+Series/default.aspx\r\n\r\nAvailable April through June.\r\n\r\nHop Henge I.P.A. was first brewed in 2006 as an agressive West Coast style I.P.A. In 2007, Hop Henge is going Imperial!  Several pounds of  Centennial, Cascade and Northern Brewer hops are in each barrel with a heavy dry-hop presence to top it off.  A blend of crystal, pale and caraston malts creates an overall biscuity characteristic that is dense and muscular, building the alcohol base to support the monstrous hop profile.\r\n\r\nLike the rest of the Bond Street Series, Hop Henge highlights the creativity and curiosity of our brewers.  Bolder than its English ancestors, with huge hops and a bitter finish, this IPA is no wallflower.\r\n\r\nAlcohol By Volume: 8.1%\r\n\t\r\n\r\nIBU 95\r\n\r\nWhen one of our brewers suggested we name our new IPA Hop Henge, he also came up with the idea of actually recreating Stonehenge, only with hop bales.  We were up for the challenge and even though the weather did not want to cooperate, we pulled it off and threw a party afterwards.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nphoto: chris mather\r\nRatings, Awards \u0026 Notables\r\n\r\nWorld's Best Strong Pale Ale (Imperial IPA)\r\n2007 World Beer Awards\r\n\r\nWorld's 50 Best Beers\r\n2006 International Beer Challenge\r\n\r\nGold Medal, 92 Points\r\n2006 World Beer Championships\r\n\r\nSilver Medal, India Pale Ale Category\r\n2006 Australian International Beer Awards\r\n\r\nModern Brewery Age, February 12, 2007\r\n5 out 5 stars \r\nHop Henge started its life as an India Pale Ale, but this year it was bumped up to Imperial IPA status, with a hefty dose of additional hops.\r\nThis one is lovely, said taster Tom Conti. They got it just right.\r\nIt pours out a deep amber, with an appealing rocky head, and rich hop aroma wafting from the glass. They sure dosed it with a lot of hops...[theres] a lot of hop bitterness in the taste, one taster observed.\r\nIn addition to the Imperial-level hopping, Hop Henge also boasts Imperial-level alcohol content, with 8.1% a.b.v.\r\nThis was the top-rated beer during its tasting session, and tasters had to dig deep for new superlatives to describe it. This is a beautiful beer, concluded taster Gregg Glaser.

Coming in at over 8%, this beer is deceptively strong.","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":5193,"brewery_id":929,"name":"Oak Creek Micro Light","cat_id":7,"style_id":77,"abv":0.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":5194,"brewery_id":929,"name":"Forty-Niner Gold Lager","cat_id":8,"style_id":95,"abv":4.5,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":5195,"brewery_id":929,"name":"Horseshoe Hefeweizen","cat_id":4,"style_id":50,"abv":4.5,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":5196,"brewery_id":929,"name":"Doc's Pale Ale","cat_id":3,"style_id":26,"abv":5.5,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":5197,"brewery_id":929,"name":"Oak Creek Amber Ale","cat_id":3,"style_id":33,"abv":5.5,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":5198,"brewery_id":929,"name":"Village Nut Brown Ale","cat_id":3,"style_id":38,"abv":6.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":5199,"brewery_id":929,"name":"Pullman Porter","cat_id":2,"style_id":25,"abv":0.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":5200,"brewery_id":546,"name":"Foster's Premium Ale","cat_id":1,"style_id":1,"abv":5.5,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":5201,"brewery_id":384,"name":"Climax IPA","cat_id":3,"style_id":31,"abv":6.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"This American-style, hop-driven beer starts with a citrus flavor, followed by two layers of caramel, and finishes on a hoppy note.","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":5202,"brewery_id":384,"name":"Climax Extra Special Bitter Ale","cat_id":1,"style_id":5,"abv":5.5,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"Our E.S.B. is a balanced beer with notes of honey, toffee and caramel, backed by a warm spicy hop bitterness.","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":5203,"brewery_id":384,"name":"Climax Nut Brown Ale","cat_id":3,"style_id":38,"abv":5.2,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"This style of beer is based on the English Mild, which was a combination of a stout and a lighter beer favored by coal miners in Scotland, Ireland and North England.\r\nWe've brought together the grains used to make both a Stout and a Pale Ale and balanced them in our Nut Brown Ale to produce a beer with a chocolate and molasses flavor and hints of caramel and coffee in the background.","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":5204,"brewery_id":384,"name":"Climax Cream Ale","cat_id":11,"style_id":113,"abv":0.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"Our Cream Ale is a light, crisp, yellow ale with hop-notes and citrus flavors.

Something that has a sting but tastes great, sounds like a Ballast Point India Pale Ale.","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":5559,"brewery_id":1301,"name":"Bitter Woman in the Rye","cat_id":11,"style_id":119,"abv":0.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":5560,"brewery_id":605,"name":"Glockenspiel","cat_id":4,"style_id":55,"abv":8.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":5561,"brewery_id":974,"name":"Doryman's Dark Ale","cat_id":3,"style_id":38,"abv":5.8,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"Our American Brown Ale has a dark brown color, with a balanced aroma of roasted malts and Northwest-grown hops.

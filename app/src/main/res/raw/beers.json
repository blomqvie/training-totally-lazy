Inversion I.P.A.'s trio of American hops delivers an over-the-top nose with hints of orange and grapefruit.  Inversion is then dry-hopped for seven days resulting in an added hoppy kick.  To balance the hop character, Deschutes brewers used crystal and caraston malts that weave throughout the beer providing soft, complex caramel flavors. \r\n\r\nJust like clear days up on the mountain, Inversion I.P.A. will deliver a path to higher ground.  Inversion I.P.A. is a phenomenal NW-style I.P.A., beckoning all beer drinkers and enticing I.P.A. lovers to invert their world and find clarity above the routine of the everyday.","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":424,"brewery_id":844,"name":"India Pale Ale","cat_id":3,"style_id":26,"abv":7.5,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":425,"brewery_id":844,"name":"London Porter","cat_id":2,"style_id":25,"abv":6.5,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":426,"brewery_id":742,"name":"Hitachino Nest Celebration Ale 2006","cat_id":-1,"style_id":-1,"abv":9.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":427,"brewery_id":363,"name":"Rubia","cat_id":8,"style_id":95,"abv":6.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":428,"brewery_id":562,"name":"Session Premium Lager","cat_id":8,"style_id":95,"abv":5.1,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":429,"brewery_id":156,"name":"Mocny BOSS / BOSS Beer","cat_id":8,"style_id":95,"abv":8.1,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":430,"brewery_id":127,"name":"La Rossa","cat_id":7,"style_id":90,"abv":7.2,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":431,"brewery_id":905,"name":"Blue Paddle Pilsener","cat_id":7,"style_id":77,"abv":4.8,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"Climb on in and grab a paddle.

In spite of its dark color, it comes across as a soft and elegant brew that is rich, mild, and surprisingly balanced. It never tastes harsh, toasty or acrid. The beer is often referred to as a Schwarzpils, a \"black Pils,\" but, unlike a blond Pils, which can be assertively bitter, the hop bitterness in Schwarzbier is always gentle and subdued.\r\n\r\nIn a glass, Schwarzbier looks much like a British dark ale, but looks can be deceiving. Schwarzbier, unlike a British ale, has a clean lager taste that leaves next to no perception of fruitiness on the palate. Instead, Schwarzbier produces very mild, almost bittersweet, notes of chocolate, coffee, and vanilla. Like most traditional German lagers, Schwarzbier has a malty middle, but the sweetness is never cloying or overpowering. The beer is moderately to well attenuated and the finish tends to be dry. Its alcohol level by volume is in the range of 4.5 to 5%, rarely higher. To accentuate the Schwarzbier's dark elegance and appealing head, always serve it in a tall, fluted or tulip-shaped glass.","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":481,"brewery_id":296,"name":"St. Bernardus Tripel","cat_id":5,"style_id":61,"abv":8.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"This beer, with high fermentation, has a pale amber colour and a flowery, fruity taste with a harmonious balance between sweet and sour (8% alcohol content). \r\nThis beer has a thick and vivid froth and strikes by its balanced taste with a delicate bitterness.","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":482,"brewery_id":296,"name":"Bire Blanche","cat_id":-1,"style_id":-1,"abv":0.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":483,"brewery_id":1375,"name":"Wychcraft","cat_id":-1,"style_id":-1,"abv":0.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":484,"brewery_id":1204,"name":"Double Bastard Ale","cat_id":3,"style_id":26,"abv":10.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":0,"last_mod":"2010-07-22T20:00:20.000Z"},{"id":485,"brewery_id":7,"name":"Rochefort 6","cat_id":3,"style_id":29,"abv":7.5,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"filepath":"","descript":"eddish colour, almost like autumn leaves, very consistent texture with a slightly spicy aroma and an intense taste of caramel, fruit, and hints of raisins.
